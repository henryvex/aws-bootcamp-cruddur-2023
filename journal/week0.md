Updates of my progress in the ongoing AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp. Here is a summary of the tasks I have completed so far for week 1:
1.	Recreated Conceptual Diagram for Twitter-like application in Lucid: I recreated the conceptual diagram for a Twitter-like application using Lucid chart. This included the front-end user interface, application server, business logic and data access layer, distributed data store, search index, message queue, and email notification system.

2.	Recreated Logical Architectural Diagram in Lucid Charts: I also recreated the logical architectural diagram using Lucid chart. This included more detail on the components of the system, including the exact services and resources needed to build and run each component.

3.	Recreated an Admin User in AWS: I created an admin user in AWS to give me the necessary permissions to create and manage AWS resources.

4.	Used CloudShell: I used CloudShell to create a virtual Linux environment in the AWS Cloud, which enabled me to run scripts and execute commands without having to install additional software on my local machine.

5.	Generated AWS Credentials: I generated AWS credentials to authenticate with AWS services and APIs using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

6.	Installed AWS CLI: I installed the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on my local machine to enable me to interact with AWS services and resources using the command line.

7.	Created a Billing Alarm: I created a billing alarm in AWS to receive email notifications when the estimated charges for my AWS account exceeded a specified threshold.

8.	Created a Budget: I also created a budget in AWS to help me manage my AWS costs and avoid unexpected charges.

I am excited about the progress I have made so far and am looking forward to continuing to build on this foundation throughout the bootcamp. Thank you for your guidance and support thus far.
